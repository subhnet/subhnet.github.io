### Step 1

Remove the `dist` directory from the project’s `.gitignore` file (it’s ignored by default by Yeoman).

### Step 2

Make sure git knows about your subtree (the subfolder with your site).

```sh
git add dist && git commit -m "Initial dist subtree commit"
```

### Step 3

Use subtree push to send it to the `gh-pages` branch on GitHub.

```sh
git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages
